Sciences Po also holds a high standard of social responsibility and continues to play a pioneering role in the promotion of diversity and equal opportunity in higher education. 30% of the student body receive financial aid at Sciences Po. In 2000, this number was 6%.\n\nOver the last decade, Sciences Po has integrated digital tools into its programmes (shared work spaces, eCourses, Moodle, online map library, Controversy Mapping, Forccast Project, etc.) and has naturally migrated towards MOOC teaching platforms as well as other innovative teaching methods.","short_name":"sciencespo","location_state":"IDF","website_youtube":"user/sciencespo","partner_type":1,"banner":"","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8/ac42002eba11e49656090d4832ad87/coursera-bandeau.jpg","name":"Sciences Po","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/16/60429009c611e5933c2d82813d6d0a/SCIENCES-PO_blason_RGB_360x360.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/15/70645009c611e589686f9cc05cf56f/SCIENCES-PO_blason_RGB_360x360.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/3a/c064d009c611e5a65ea3e7f8214822/SCIENCES-PO_blason_RGB_360x360.svg","home_link":"","class_logo":"","display":true},{"rectangular_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/57/8ac9e0570311e5b74dcf02bdb96b72/MSMC_Icahn_CMYK_Hrztl.svg","website_twitter":"mountsinainyc","favicon":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/6e/050cc941c1081a711d979b25b7b108/Course_catalog_page_16x16.png","website_facebook":"IcahnMountSinai","logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/40/20e4ab932508164766302a9bf01c5c/mount_sinai.png","location_lat":40.71435280000000000,"location_lng":-74.00597310000000000,"location_city":"New York","location_country":"US","id":27,"location":"New York, NY","primary_color":"#0F487C","abbr_name":"Mount Sinai","website":"http://icahn.mssm.edu/","description":"The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York City is a leader in medical and scientific training and education, biomedical research and patient care.","short_name":"mssm","location_state":"NY","website_youtube":"mountsinaischool","partner_type":1,"banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/bd/336920ea0411e5abe1133ac5dcedb7/131028_hamerman_290-copy.jpg","landing_page_banner":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/a8/2edb40ea0411e5b06c8fe32279023e/131028_hamerman_290-copy.jpg","name":"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","square_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8e/fb1b10d65a11e596ac715741f11cf8/ISMMS_logo.png","square_logo_source":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/8d/e7d650d65a11e5b6afb1b82d4d5acf/ISMMS_logo.png","square_logo_svg":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/1e/473316258fb5cff7cbc578c663fa68/MS.svg","home_link":null,"class_logo":"https://coursera-university-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/08/12135ab4bd100a1f10b71eef88fd1a/wide_logo_200X48_v2.png","display":true}],"topics":{"2058":{"insts":[544426],"subtitle_languages_csv":"","photo":"https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/3d/c08d802cf011e4a56e09598f8b6c89/14206197688_59beebd5e5_o.jpg","preview_link":"https://class.coursera.org/surveillance-001/lecture/preview","small_icon_hover":"https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/3e/bb1a202cf011e4b960f5cbb870f496/14206197688_59beebd5e5_o.jpg","large_icon":"https://d15cw65ipctsrr.cloudfront.net/3e/b96c702cf011e49c06abd4a1eac6cf/14206197688_59beebd5e5_o.jpg","video":"259478a0290511e48d1649f0d4595119","unis":[1],"video_baseurl":"https://d1a2y8pfnfh44t.cloudfront.net/259478a0290511e48d1649f0d4595119/","id":2058,"self_service_course_id":null,"order_idx":338,"cats":[11,21],"short_description":"Learn how police and intelligence agencies can access your data, and how the law (might) protect you!

A perfect score in the class was 90 points.\n\nYou need to have achieved at least 75 points (83.3% of the total possible) to receive a Statement of Accomplishment. You must also have posted in the forums at least five times.\n\nA detailed explanation of how your grade was calculated follows.\n\nIn its grading, Coursera does not provide a simple means for using \u201cAND\u201d statements such as, \"You must have received a total score of at least 83.3% and have posted in the forums at least five times.\" Therefore, the equation I entered into their automated scoring system was,\n\nWhichever is less:\n\n\u201cThe sum of your reading quizzes and forum activities, all divided by 90 and multiplied by 100\u201d\n\nOR\n\n\u201cThe sum of your posts in the forum (up to five) multiplied by 20.\u201d\n\nThe result must have been greater than 83.3.\n\nFor example,\n\n1) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 90% and you posted in the forums at least five times (100%), your final score will show as 90% and you will receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\n2) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 90% but you didn't post in the forums at all (0%), your final score will show as 0% and you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\n3) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 80% and you posted in the forum at least five times (100%), your final score will show as 80% and you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\n4) If your total score on your reading quizzes and forum activities was 80% and you didn't post in the forums at all (0%), your final score will show as 0% and you will not receive a Statement of Accomplishment.\n\nTwo important notes:\n\nFirst, I set up all of the forum activity reporting logs such that the possible answers to each question were always \"Yes\" followed by \"No.\" When I set up the forum activities for Questions 14 and 15, I neglected to uncheck the box that randomizes the answers by default. Thus, when you went to record your forum activities in Week 8, it was possible that \"No\" may have preceded \"Yes,\" which would have been inconsistent with what you were accustomed to in the previous seven weeks. I decided, therefore, to give all of you full credit (3 points each) for these two forum activities.\n\nSecond, I set the minimum number of forum posts required to receive a certificate at five, but in reality it would have been impossible to have achieved 75 of the 90 points possible in the course without having posted in the forum at least seven times. (I am allowing flexibility on two posts.) The explanation is as follows: If a perfect score on all fifteen reading quizzes is assumed (45 points), then a perfect score on ten forum activities (30 points) would still be needed to reach 75 points. Of the fifteen forum activities, there were only three that did not require posting in the forums: Questions 5, 10, and 12. (Posting your answer for the Question 12 forum activity was optional, and the forum activities for Questions 5 and 10 required you to participate in the forum, which technically could have been satisfied by simply voting up or down on posts.)","ace_open_date":null,"home_link":"https://class.coursera.org/globalfoodsystems-001/","certificates_ready":true,"university_logo":null,"signature_track_close_time":null},{"grading_policy_distinction":"","ace_track_price_display":null,"signature_track_price":39.00,"ace_semester_hours":null,"start_year":2013,"duration_string":"6 weeks","id":970556,"start_month":5,"certificate_description":"This course covers breeding management, reproductive disease, and contraception and sterilization of dogs.

At the heart of the course are the discussion boards.  Each week we offer a discussion question that we ask all students to answer.  You can find these questions here.  In addition to these required discussion questions, we have created three essay assignments.  Each of these assignments helps you practice the craft of historical research and analysis.  You can find the instructions for these assignments here.  We ask that you post your essay assignments to the discussion board so that all your peers can learn from your work.  We also ask that you comment on your peers' essay assignments.  You can find instructions for peer reflection here.\n\nIn order to earn a Statement of Accomplishment or Verified Certificate, you must score a score a 70-percent in the course.  Answers to the weekly discussion board posts are weighted at 70-percent of the grade and the three essay assignments are weighted at 30-percent of the grade.  Neither the discussion question responses nor the essay assignments are evaluated on an A-F or 0-100 scale.  Instead, so long as you upload your responses in the proper forums, you will receive credit.  We are far more concerned with providing you the prompts, tools, and feedback for meaningful learning than we are about precision in grading in this non-credit course.\n\nIn an effort to not penalize those who join this course late, we are allowing students to submit work all the way to the final day of the final week without penalty.  That said, this is as much a community as it is a course, so we have provided you with suggested deadlines (you can find these in the syllabus) and hope to see the majority of you make an effort to keep pace.  If you have any questions about the weekly discussions, please direct them here.  And if you have any questions about the three essay assignments, please direct them here.
